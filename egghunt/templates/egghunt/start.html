                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>
                        The eEaster Egg Hunt works like any other.
                        You start with a clue.
                        The clue leads you to a location.
                        At the location, you'll find another clue.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Using the map</h3>
                    <p>
                        To search for a clue at a location, you drop a pin on the map at that location and click "Search Here".
                    </p>

                    <h3>Resuming</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can pause and resume the hunt at any time. Just remember the last location that you visited.
                        When you want to resume, return to that location using the map.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Solving the clues</h3>
                    <p>
                        The clues can be <em>difficult</em> and you're not expected to "just know it".
                        Using Google <strong>is allowed</strong>.
                        Using Google search-by-image <strong>is not allowed</strong>.
                        Anything you think is probably cheating, is cheating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For every clue, your pin needs to be within a certain radius of the true location to be accepted.
                        If you think you have the right answer but it is not accepted, try to get closer to the precise location.
                    </p>
